# Exercise:
# Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number.
# (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number
# For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

number = int(input("Enter one number: "))

listRange = list(range(1, number + 1))
divisorsList = []

for x in listRange:
    if number % x == 0:
        divisorsList.append(x)

print(divisorsList)
